        <p class="mySentence">
            It was established in 2014 by a group of young, driven, and dynamic licensed real estate brokers and entrepreneurs who 
            were inspired by the flourishing real estate industry in Northern Mindanao and the entire country.
        </p>
        <p class="mySentence">
            The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of SEERS Property Management Group Inc. on April 14, 2014, with the primary purpose of engaging in integrated property management programs, projects, and services; pursuing property management ventures with other strategic partners and stakeholders and explore other opportunities for innovative engagements with 
            other entities and individuals for the expansion of the corporation’s network and services.
        </p>
        <p class="mySentence">
            While initially envisioned as a traditional property management firm, 
            the new normal has presented opportunities for SEERS to expand on.
        </p>
        <p class="mySentence">
            In 2022, SEERS amended its corporate purpose with the Securities and Exchange Commission and expanded its reach as an outsourced service company specializing in Credit Investigation Services, Collection, and Receivable Management as well as ventures on Document Processing and Registrations for real estate loans, chattels, encumbrances, and other related services. This expansion is guided by one of the incorporators (Atty Beda Joy B. Elot, CPA, REB, MM) experience as a loan’s processor and banker for Eight (8) years before she joined the government in 2001. Aside from this, SEERS had through the years been able to establish firm and reliable contacts in the relevant government entities, such as the Register of Deeds, Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the Land Transportation Office, 
            among others, a considerable competitive advantage for the corporation.
